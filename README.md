# README

Just a simple collection of PHP scripts to demo a few insecurities commonly found in PHP code and fixing them.

Please keep in mind that each example is specific to protecting against the vulnerability it was written to demo, it would still be susceptible to other vulerabilities.

Use this code at your own risk!

Cheers and shout out to [OWASP PHP Filters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_PHP_Filters)
